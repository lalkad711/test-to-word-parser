# text-to-word-parser 

* This application reads normal text files, e.g. *.in files, and tries to split them into sentences.
It then splits these sentences into respective words, within each of them, and then tries to arrange them into sorted order (Ascending by default).

* The application internally uses the java.text.Breakiterator API to logically break down the text into sentences and words based on the predefined rules. This API sets boundries for sentences in text and for words in sentences respectively.
Once split, we then try to write these sentences in the order of their occurrence and the word in the asceding order.
